    <p>1. There are so many reasons I love swimming. It’s very comforting for me to be in the water and it’s such a unique feeling. You can’t find the same feeling anywhere else. Swimming is my inner peace!”</p><br>
    
    <p>2.Cooking is a highly creative hobby to take up. You can create your own dishes, tweak well known recipes, blend your favorite cuisines, your creative juices will be in full flow</p><br>
<p>3.It builds serious "CORE STRENGTH"</p><br>

<p>
    4.The warmth of the sun, the soothing sound of the waves , the soft sand underfoot, the therapeutic … – the sparkling in the water from the reflection of the sun and the patterns it paints … Because it`s impossible not to be happy on the beach! Everyone is happy on the beach and everything is so much more fun.</p>
